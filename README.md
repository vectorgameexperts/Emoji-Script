# Google Noto Animation Scraper

Per the the FAQ section of [Google Noto's Animated Emojis](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/), 
  > How do I download everything?
  >  
  > Currently, there is no way to download the whole set â€” the world is not ready for that many simultaneously dancing emoji.  

We challenge that statement as the harbingers of a new world order. So we made a script to generate a CSV to the file names and download links.

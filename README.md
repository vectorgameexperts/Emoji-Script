# Google Noto Animation Scraper

Per the the FAQ section of [Google Noto's Animated Emojis](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/),
  > How do I download everything?
  >
  > Currently, there is no way to download the whole set â€” the world is not ready for that many simultaneously dancing emoji.

This is a script to make the world ready.
